          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In this assignemnt, we are focusing in learning about casting. No better reason to start thinking of a new planter for my apartment! I would like to focus on something simple in desing, yet complex/challenging in execution. Not over-the-top grasshoppery thingies, but a rather smooth and delineated shape.</p>
          <p><img src="A7/SKETCHES2.jpg" width="764" height="691" alt=""/>--The Shapes --</p>
          <p>I went through several iterations of the design. I learned about Kangaroo, a physics solver inside of Rhino that helped crate the giant geodomes of some of the largest public spaces in the world. However, my first attempts did not go at all as I planned.</p>
          <p><img src="A7/WormDnaicng.gif" width="791" height="774" alt=""/></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I wanted Kangaroo to add negative pressure to some areas of the planter, and &quot;inflate them&quot; to add a draping effect to them.</p>
          <p><img src="A7/Optionslineup.jpg" width="795" height="718" alt=""/></p>
          <p>At the end, I decided to go with one of my first sketches, and stick with the draping effect using kangaroo. Watching the solver compute these tensions is mesmerizing. </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>-- Moldception --</strong></p>
          <p>With the final shape, I thought the rest would be very easy, but I was wrong. Having a cup-shaped planter meant that a regular 2 part mold would not cut it (or mold it.) I need a void in the center of this shape, and if I only do 2 molds, either the Oomo or the cement could get trapped. </p>
          <p>Strategy &gt;&gt; I decided to create a 3-piece mold. 2 on the sides, and one at the top that enters the cup to create its void. To save as much material as possible, I decided to work with the same curvature as the cup for all of the molds.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><img src="A7/cuts lineup.jpg" width="768" height="736" alt=""/></p>
          <p>As the picture suggests, having 3 fully encompassing models not only increases the number of Oomo to three, but elevates the number of 3D printed parts needed to 6! </p>
          <p>Each of the oomo sections require a specific thickness and shape. hence, this assignment is taking 60 hours to print in 3D!<br>

          <p><strong>-- Oomo Oomo--</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Adding the</strong> Oomo was easier that I thought. </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>-- Oomo Fail --</strong></p>
          <p>Two consecutive Oomo shipments through Amazon came already solidified. Shelf life is very short for this product. I ended up going to a local store to get it.</p>
          <p><img src="A7/Pot_11.jpg" width="792" height="792" alt=""/></p>
          <p>-- Wait Time --</p>
          <p>I waited 24 hours before separating the molds from the 3D prints. It was relatively easy, however, I could hear the prints cracking, I dont think they can be used fgor a second time.</p>
          <p><img src="A7/Pot_12.jpg" width="792" height="1057" alt=""/></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-- Ready for casting --</p>
          <p>This is the combined Oomo mold. I realized I could use some of the initial 3D prints to hold the shape of the oomo in place while the cement solidified.</p>
          <p><img src="A7/Pot_13.jpg" width="792" height="792" alt=""/><img src="A7/Pot_14.jpg" width="793" height="899" alt=""/></p>
          <p>-- Solidifed Cement --</p>
          <p>After opening the Oomo mold, I realized I gave the pot a very thin structure. It feels really nice, but I would make it thicker if I did it again. I gotta be careful where I put it. I realized there are still several air bubbles, tiny ones trapped in the mold. </p>

          <p>-- A new planter --</p>
          <p>And that concludes this journey, I have a new planter I am looking forward to keeping around my desk. But here are some more designy photos of the final product. </p>
