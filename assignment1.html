          <p>For our first assignment, we got familiarized with the usage of a laser cutter by calibrating its power and speed, and cutting simple shapes in Rhinoceros. This is my final product:</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>1. First, we need to understand the relationship between the laser cutter's power, its speed and the material we have. I am using a very thin black cardboard/paperboard, howeve, its dense. It might burn quickly, but it might not go throught that easily. I did a series of tests to determine ideal settings for the glowforge.</p>

          <p>2. The next step was to figure out how the shapes would be adecuately assembled. I discovered that making the aperture the same width as your material does not necesarily guarantee the best results - hence, I did a few tests to determine appropiate width for this particular cut.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3. Design - for the next step, I started working with Rhino. I wanted something modular that belonged to a grid, regardless of which combination you put the pieces at.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>4. Next, I needed to create 3 to 4 variations that would allow to manage the pieces around the sculpture. I created a a few shapes by joining some of this grids with organic moves, as &quot;teardrops&quot; that are combining each circle with the one next to it.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>5. After having an adecuate number of modules drafted. I removed them from the grid and organized them for laser cutting in a 11.5 x 20&quot; sheet (the size of our cardboard.)</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>6.Finally, I cut all pieces and assembled them in a 4x4 grid, attempting to create a simi-completed cube with cantilevers and other interesting spaces in between.</p>
